Include:</p><ul><li>Specific error messages to search for</li><li>Symptoms that distinguish this from similar issues</li><li>Version numbers, environment details, or configuration states</li></ul><p>Remember what every old hand knows: Half of support tickets are people applying the wrong fix to the right problem. The other half are people applying the right fix to the wrong problem.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-3>Post-Mortem: Proving the Fix Actually Worked</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-3><p>Changes don't always take hold immediately. Caches exist. Services need restarts. The universe is indifferent to your deployment.</p><p>Provide clear verification steps:</p><ul><li>What output/behavior should change</li><li>How long to wait before panicking</li><li>Common reasons the fix might not apply (caching, permissions, phase of moon)</li></ul><p>The person following your doc should never have to wonder "did it work?" They should <strong>know</strong>.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-4>The Escape Hatch: Reverting Your Mess</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3><p>Nothing strikes fear like "irreversible changes." Give users:</p><ul><li>Explicit revert instructions</li><li>Which changes are reversible vs permanent</li><li>What they should backup before starting</li></ul><p>Sometimes these steps are obvious, sometimes they are not. Sometimes you think they are obvious, but they are not.</p><p>If you can't provide revert steps, start your doc with "POINT OF NO RETURN AHEAD"</p></div></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-5>Bonus Points: Separating Good Docs from Great Docs</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-2><ul><li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Required permissions, tools, access levels, or ritual sacrifices</li><li><strong>Breaking Changes</strong>: "Fixing X will break Y" belongs at the <strong>top</strong> of your doc, not buried in paragraph seven. Users who discover downstream breakage after applying your fix will remember you, and not fondly.</li><li><strong>External References</strong>: Link to relevant docs, upstream issues, RFCs, or the blog post that caused this mess in the first place.</li><li><strong>Sanity Checks Throughout</strong>: Add verification steps between major operations. Let users catch mistakes early rather than at the catastrophic finale.</li><li><strong>Troubleshooting Section</strong>: "If Step 3 fails with error X, try Y"</li><li><strong>Related Issues and Rabbit Holes</strong>: Link to similar issues that might be confused with this one. Save future-you from explaining the difference for the hundredth time.</li><li><strong>Common Pitfalls</strong>: The mistakes 80% of people make when following this doc</li><li><strong>Time Estimates</strong>: How long each step takes (including waiting for DNS propagation until heat death of universe)</li><li><strong>Here be dragons:</strong> Doing something high technical, poking into internals or using some software in a way it was not intended? Mark it down.</li></ul></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-6>Conclusion</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-2><p>Good fix documentation is like good code: it handles edge cases, provides clear feedback, and doesn't leave users wondering what just happened.</p><p>Bad fix documentation is also like bad code: it assumes a perfect world, fails silently, and generates technical debt in the form of confused users and repeat tickets (or even worse completely NEW tickets caused by it).</p><p>Write the doc you'd be okay with sending to a psychopath who knows your address.</p></div></div></main><footer><hr>© 2026 npalladium</footer></body></html>
