#+title: Autocorrect helps unravel what little is left of my sanity
#+author: npalladium

I’m the world’s most frustrated man, \\
My brain is fried, my thumbs are weak. \\
I thought more AI would solve my problem, \\
But now the outlook’s rather bleak. \\
Give me a pen, a piece of paper, \\
A stick, a rock, a bit of clay; \\
The duck king Autocorrect never understood, \\
The things I actually wanted to say.
